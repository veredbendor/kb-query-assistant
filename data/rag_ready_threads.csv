Good evening <PERSON>,  or SR on duty,




I purchased the HIPAA course with 62 forms in <DATE_TIME>. Wondering if the forms have been updated 

or if the format changed to fillable forms. I have not started using the forms and am considering creating fillable forms. If you have the forms in a new format can you let me know the cost for updating the package?

Hello <PERSON>,







Thanks for your reply and that information. After checking, I do see your order. When you have a moment please log into your <PERSON> account. Once logged in, click on ""My account"" in the top right. Click ""My courses"" from the dropdown options. Once the next page
 loads, scroll down to your ""Completed"" section (<IN_PAN>: <IN_PAN>) and click to show the course(s) you have completed. Click ""Review and access certificate"". The next page will be the activity progress section. Click ""Content"" on this page (<IN_PAN>:activity
 progress). Once the content of the course loads, scroll down to the very bottom of this page. You'll see a link that says ""Clinical Forms (word docx)"". Clicking here will start the download of those files to your computer/device.







Please let us know if you have any questions!

Hi Michelle - I had purchased eight codes for our MSW students to use to complete the <IN_PAN> health certificate program. One of the students contacted me <DATE_TIME> and said that when she tried to access it, the link was expired.




<URL>




Is there a reason that this link is no longer available? I want the students to be able to access the course that we paid for.




Best,

Good morning Dr. <PERSON>,

We would be happy to offer you the same rate for the training <DATE_TIME>. 


I will put together an invoice and send it to you shortly.

Please let me know once the invoice has been paid, as we do not receive notification of payment.
Once I hear back from you, I will provide you with a CODE that the students can use to make the purchase.

The easiest way for your students to access the trainings will be that they each create their own Zur Institute account. They can do that at the following link: Sign
 Up – Zur Institute
Once they have created their account, they can enter the  <IN_PAN>
 Health and Digital Ethics Package to their cart and proceed to checkout. They will enter this code at checkout, the balance will go to $0, and the courses will be added to their account.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you!

It’s missing a course from the original certificate program he wanted and they won’t get a final certificate. He also wanted the 21 CEs and this is now 19 CEs.

Hi Robert - when the student is trying to register, they get the following message

The student has no way to complete the registration without actually entering credit card information.  Can you please identify some way for us to enter the code?

Good morning Dr. <PERSON>,

We would be happy to offer you the same rate for the training <DATE_TIME>. 


I will put together an invoice and send it to you shortly.

Please let me know once the invoice has been paid, as we do not receive notification of payment.
Once I hear back from you, I will provide you with a CODE that the students can use to make the purchase.

The easiest way for your students to access the trainings will be that they each create their own Zur Institute account. They can do that at the following link: Sign
 Up – Zur Institute
Once they have created their account, they can enter the  <IN_PAN>
 Health and Digital Ethics Package to their cart and proceed to checkout. They will enter this code at checkout, the balance will go to $0, and the courses will be added to their account.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you!

Good <DATE_TIME> - I have a <IN_PAN> health grant for MSW students and one of the <IN_PAN> of the grant is to provide <IN_PAN> health training to the students. For <DATE_TIME>, I have had the students complete the certificate training through Zur Institute.
 <DATE_TIME>, we <IN_PAN> a rate of $150 per student for the eight students participating in the training, for a total of $1200.



I'm wondering if we could do a group rate again for the training as well as get some sort of group log-in for students to access the training? <IN_PAN>, I could provide their names and email addresses as a way to get them access, as well.




I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Robert - when the student is trying to register, they get the following message



""<IN_PAN> coupons cannot be applied because some items in your cart have discounts pre-applied.""




The student has no way to complete the registration without actually entering credit card information.  Can you please identify some way for us to enter the code? 




Thanks.

Good morning Dr. <PERSON>,

We would be happy to offer you the same rate for the training <DATE_TIME>. 


I will put together an invoice and send it to you shortly.

Please let me know once the invoice has been paid, as we do not receive notification of payment.
Once I hear back from you, I will provide you with a CODE that the students can use to make the purchase.

The easiest way for your students to access the trainings will be that they each create their own Zur Institute account. They can do that at the following link: Sign
 Up – Zur Institute
Once they have created their account, they can enter the  <IN_PAN>
 Health and Digital Ethics Package to their cart and proceed to checkout. They will enter this code at checkout, the balance will go to $0, and the courses will be added to their account.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you!

Hi Robert - when the student is trying to register, they get the following message

The student has no way to complete the registration without actually entering credit card information.  Can you please identify some way for us to enter the code?

Hi Robert - when the student is trying to register, they get the following message



""<IN_PAN> coupons cannot be applied because some items in your cart have discounts pre-applied.""




The student has no way to complete the registration without actually entering credit card information.  Can you please identify some way for us to enter the code? 




Thanks.

Good morning Dr. <PERSON>,

We would be happy to offer you the same rate for the training <DATE_TIME>. 


I will put together an invoice and send it to you shortly.

Please let me know once the invoice has been paid, as we do not receive notification of payment.
Once I hear back from you, I will provide you with a CODE that the students can use to make the purchase.

The easiest way for your students to access the trainings will be that they each create their own Zur Institute account. They can do that at the following link: Sign
 Up – Zur Institute
Once they have created their account, they can enter the  <IN_PAN>
 Health and Digital Ethics Package to their cart and proceed to checkout. They will enter this code at checkout, the balance will go to $0, and the courses will be added to their account.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you!

<IN_PAN> my medical condition is now improved, and my request is to explore if it might be facilitated for me to complete the course on an extended timeline due to extenuating circumstances above. My proposal is for me to complete Modules 6 and Module 8 from the video <IN_PAN>, in parallel to <IN_PAN> the <IN_PAN> reading.

Hi <PERSON>,
 
Sorry for any confusion as a result of Destiny's announcement.  She was providing instructions for our typical webinars.  We will spend some extraWe decided to take a different approach to this training, which has produced some <IN_PAN> consequences and we may change our <IN_PAN> after session 4.  If we do, we will let you know.
 
The way our system is set up for this training is as follows:
 

Posttest and CE certificates: This training is broken into three segments.  Part 1 is comprised of sessions 1-4, Part 2 is comprised of sessions <DATE_TIME>, and part 3 is the two practice sessions.

 
Unlike our other trainings, this is set up in a way that participants will complete a posttest after each Part or 4 sessions.  Parts 1 and 2 are worth 15 CE credits, and after <IN_PAN> Part 3, which is essentially an honor's system, you will receive your EMDR certificate.  There is nothing to keep you from <IN_PAN> all the posttest questions at any time, though.
 
Hence you will not receive an <IN_PAN> form to fill out, nor an announcement regarding the posttest until following session 4.
<DATE_TIME> refers to how long after a typical webinar, but not this one, it will take before you receive the link to take the posttest.
The <DATE_TIME> requirement does not apply to this training so you can ignore that entirely.
 
On another matter, since you refer to CPD, I presume you are in CA?  If so, it is possible you might be able to apply the 2 practice sessions as consultation.  The rules are vague, and I doubt the staff at BOP can add clarification, but it is something to consider.
 
If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to reach out.

I have attended all training sessions to date, 
1). <DATE_TIME>, 
2). <DATE_TIME> and 
3). <DATE_TIME> [practical session] and 
4). <DATE_TIME>.
I am seeking your guidance/assistance with understanding the requirements [in addition to the attendance at the sessions above] that is required in order to receive CPD certification for the course.
<PERSON> explained <DATE_TIME> [and on previous sessions] that it is necessary to complete an evaluation which is emailed after each session, and to complete the post-test within <DATE_TIME> of completing the module. 
While I have on each occasion received emails alerting me to the next session, which have included the required zoom link, including the separate notification and zoom link for the practice session, I have not however received any evaluation emails after the sessions.  I have however access to the recording of each session when I log in, so seem to be on the system.
The session notifications arrive by email with the sender title of ZOOM, and I have checked for emails with that title, and also checked ZUR Institute and other emails, [including spam folder] and am quite sure of not having received any evaluation emails after the sessions.
I may have misunderstood Destiny, but am a little confused [and anxious] that fail to submit a course  requirements, so would be extremely grateful if you could explain what exactly I have to do, and how I access an individual session evaluation if such a requirement exist.
Can I also check the actual submission date for the 90 Question post-test which was distributed in the course materials prior to session one – am I correct that this post test is due within <DATE_TIME> of having completed the course overall? Is this a course post-test or a module post-test?
I am particularly anxious regarding any requirement that is due within <DATE_TIME>, as the course commenced <DATE_TIME> which would make such submission imminent. 
On a positive note I think the course is excellent, and facilitated masterfully by <PERSON>.
Please let me know as soon as possible especially if the case of any deadline.

My proposal is for me to complete Modules 6 and Module 8 from the video <IN_PAN>, in parallel to <IN_PAN> the <IN_PAN> reading. Having completed these modules and reading, to then complect the program post-test and  complete practice sessions with <PERSON> on <DATE_TIME>, <DATE_TIME> and <DATE_TIME>, <DATE_TIME>. 
My hope, if permissible, would be to have all course work and examination work completed by <DATE_TIME>.  I could make an earlier deadline if required, but would <IN_PAN> the <DATE_TIME> deadline if possible.
 
Kind Regards,
<PERSON> 

 
 


 



From: Zur <<EMAIL_ADDRESS>>To: mckennakj <<EMAIL_ADDRESS>>Date: <DATE_TIME> 5:47 PM <IN_PAN>: Re:[## 54877 ##] Requirements for CPD Certificate for EMDR Course


Hi <PERSON>,
 
Sorry for any confusion as a result of Destiny's announcement.  She was providing instructions for our typical webinars.  We will spend some extraWe decided to take a different approach to this training, which has produced some <IN_PAN> consequences and we may change our <IN_PAN> after session 4.  If we do, we will let you know.
 
The way our system is set up for this training is as follows:
 

Posttest and CE certificates: This training is broken into three segments.  Part 1 is comprised of sessions 1-4, Part 2 is comprised of sessions <DATE_TIME>, and part 3 is the two practice sessions.

 
Unlike our other trainings, this is set up in a way that participants will complete a posttest after each Part or 4 sessions.  Parts 1 and 2 are worth 15 CE credits, and after <IN_PAN> Part 3, which is essentially an honor's system, you will receive your EMDR certificate.  There is nothing to keep you from <IN_PAN> all the posttest questions at any time, though.
 
Hence you will not receive an <IN_PAN> form to fill out, nor an announcement regarding the posttest until following session 4.
<DATE_TIME> refers to how long after a typical webinar, but not this one, it will take before you receive the link to take the posttest.
The <DATE_TIME> requirement does not apply to this training so you can ignore that entirely.
 
On another matter, since you refer to CPD, I presume you are in CA?  If so, it is possible you might be able to apply the 2 practice sessions as consultation.  The rules are vague, and I doubt the staff at BOP can add clarification, but it is something to consider.
 
If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to reach out.

<DATE_TIME>,
My name is <PERSON>, my email is <EMAIL_ADDRESS> 
I am registered and attending the Virtual EMDR Certificate Training with <PERSON>, which commenced on <DATE_TIME> and is scheduled to conclude on <DATE_TIME>. 
I have attended all training sessions to date, 
1). <DATE_TIME>, 
2). <DATE_TIME> and 
3). <DATE_TIME> [practical session] and 
4). <DATE_TIME>.
I am seeking your guidance/assistance with understanding the requirements [in addition to the attendance at the sessions above] that is required in order to receive CPD certification for the course.
<PERSON> explained <DATE_TIME> [and on previous sessions] that it is necessary to complete an evaluation which is emailed after each session, and to complete the post-test within <DATE_TIME> of completing the module. 
While I have on each occasion received emails alerting me to the next session, which have included the required zoom link, including the separate notification and zoom link for the practice session, I have not however received any evaluation emails after the sessions.  I have however access to the recording of each session when I log in, so seem to be on the system.
The session notifications arrive by email with the sender title of ZOOM, and I have checked for emails with that title, and also checked ZUR Institute and other emails, [including spam folder] and am quite sure of not having received any evaluation emails after the sessions.
I may have misunderstood Destiny, but am a little confused [and anxious] that fail to submit a course  requirements, so would be extremely grateful if you could explain what exactly I have to do, and how I access an individual session evaluation if such a requirement exist.
Can I also check the actual submission date for the 90 Question post-test which was distributed in the course materials prior to session one – am I correct that this post test is due within <DATE_TIME> of having completed the course overall? Is this a course post-test or a module post-test?
I am particularly anxious regarding any requirement that is due within <DATE_TIME>, as the course commenced <DATE_TIME> which would make such submission imminent. 
On a positive note I think the course is excellent, and facilitated masterfully by <PERSON>.
Please let me know as soon as possible especially if the case of any deadline.
Kind Regards,
<PERSON>

Hi <PERSON>,It was great to speak with you <DATE_TIME>. I wanted to send a follow up with some thoughts based on our conversation.I am <IN_PAN> in the idea of providing a <DATE_TIME> and a <DATE_TIME> training. In thinking more about the topics we discussed, I think that a brief (<DATE_TIME>) training on interdisciplinary communication and collaboration skills could be useful. I would frame it as not just for providers working directly on interdisciplinary teams, but for those who communicate or are <IN_PAN> in interacting with other disciplines to improve patient care. As for learning <IN_PAN>, I'm thinking the following:1. Discuss the rationale for using effective interdisciplinary communication and collaboration <IN_PAN> for mental health <IN_PAN>. 

Learn <IN_PAN> to communicate clearly and assertively with professionals from diverse disciplines while maintaining mutual respect and shared goals

3. Identify common sources of conflict within interdisciplinary communication and implement <IN_PAN> for resolving differences constructively4. Gain skills to effectively advocate for the mental health needs of patients in care planning discussions with other <IN_PAN> professionals

Additionally, as for the longer training, I'm excited about the idea of focusing on the overlap between medical <IN_PAN> and mental/<IN_PAN> health <IN_PAN>. As for learning <IN_PAN>, I'm thinking the following:1. Explain the bidirectional relationship between physical and mental health and its implications for patient <PERSON>. Recognize physical health <IN_PAN> experienced by patients with <IN_PAN> health concerns, such as diabetes, cardiovascular issues, or chronic pain3. Identify ways to assess physical health <IN_PAN> that may mimic or <IN_PAN> health symptoms4. 

Develop skills to incorporate lifestyle factors, such as nutrition, exercise, and sleep, into <IN_PAN> health <PERSON>. 

Learn evidence-based <IN_PAN> for <IN_PAN> lifestyle factors that <IN_PAN> impact both physical and mental health6. Demonstrate effective communication and collaboration <IN_PAN> with other <IN_PAN> professionals to ensure comprehensive care  Happy to set up another time to chat more about this if <IN_PAN>.

In an attempt to keep with both the spirit and the letter of the law, we develop for professionals in states that require state specific ethics courses, content that cover all the
 current laws as well as review of the professional association's  codes of ethics.  





Th HIPAA course certainly qualifies as a law and ethics course and does cover information pertinent to the practice of <IN_PAN> in the state of CA.   While in all probability,
 you will not have any <IN_PAN>, we cannot provide advice as to whether the board will ask for more.  We simply do not know.  Unfortunately, if you inquire, they are not likely to respond as they do not look at the <IN_PAN>
 courses people submit as part of renewal.  


Thus, all we can do is provide the information that guides our development of courses.



The course you purchased includes the <NRP> forms plus <DATE_TIME> of CEs.
If you would like, we can switch out the <DATE_TIME> course with the ethics course for CA psychologists and provide the latest HIPAA kit. 



Sorry if this is so complicated.  It would be helpful to everyone if the boards would simplify these processes.

Thank you for reaching out <DATE_TIME>. The <DATE_TIME> version course is essentially the same, with only minor <IN_PAN> that are not significant enough to warrant  taking it instead. I checked on the requirement and you can use this course for ethics if you are

Hi Dr. <PERSON>,



Following is from CA statutes:



(b) Any
 person renewing or reactivating their license shall certify under penalty of perjury to the Board of <IN_PAN> as requested on the application for license renewal, that the licensee has obtained training in the subject of laws and ethics as they apply to
 the practice of <IN_PAN> in <LOCATION>. The training shall include recent changes/updates on the laws and regulations related to the practice of <IN_PAN>; recent changes/updates in the Ethical <IN_PAN> of Psychologists and Code of Conduct published by
 the American Psychological Association; accepted standards of practice; and other applications of laws and ethics as they affect the licensee's ability to practice <IN_PAN> with safety to the public. 



As with all statutes, interpretation of requirements is vague, leaving both us and people needing to renew their licenses in a state of uncertainty.



In an attempt to keep with both the spirit and the letter of the law, we develop for professionals in states that require state specific ethics courses, content that cover all the
 current laws as well as review of the professional association's  codes of ethics.  





Th HIPAA course certainly qualifies as a law and ethics course and does cover information pertinent to the practice of <IN_PAN> in the state of CA.   While in all probability,
 you will not have any <IN_PAN>, we cannot provide advice as to whether the board will ask for more.  We simply do not know.  Unfortunately, if you inquire, they are not likely to respond as they do not look at the <IN_PAN>
 courses people submit as part of renewal.  


Thus, all we can do is provide the information that guides our development of courses.



The course you purchased includes the <NRP> forms plus <DATE_TIME> of CEs.
If you would like, we can switch out the <DATE_TIME> course with the ethics course for CA psychologists and provide the latest HIPAA kit. 



Sorry if this is so complicated.  It would be helpful to everyone if the boards would simplify these processes.



Let us know if you would like us to switch the courses.

 has not been completed. In this case, both of those time periods have passed. The coupon code <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> will
 give 15% off the course.

Hello Dr. <PERSON>,





Thank you for reaching out <DATE_TIME>. The <DATE_TIME> version course is essentially the same, with only minor <IN_PAN> that are not significant enough to warrant  taking it instead. I checked on the requirement and you can use this course for ethics if you are
 not a psychologist. For psychologists, regulations require training to include content on laws relevant to <LOCATION> psychologists, which this course does not.  We have a course that is specific to psychologists in CA and that can be found here:



<IN_PAN> Professional Ethics for Psychologists





Here's a discount code in case you wanted to add this course:  <US_DRIVER_LICENSE>





Please let us know if you have any questions. We hope you have a great evening!

Hi, I don't remember why I bought this course and never finished it. It looks like I started it in <DATE_TIME>. I need to fulfill my ethical /legal requirement before <DATE_TIME>. Please let me know if this course is the most current one? and
 if it fulfills the requirement? I am assuming there is no updated version but I want to make sure htat is the case.

Robert,




I followed your instructions, but to no avail.  It asks me to reset my password, but when I follow prompts, it takes me to a page asking me what my <IN_PAN> is, tells me how many ceus I need, etc.  It won't let me change my password.

I sit down to view this video when I have the tie to commit to it, but can never make it work.

Hello <PERSON>, With rare exception, courses are not approved, providers are.  Hence, as NBCC approves us as CE providers, we can provide CE credit for all of our courses.

Dear CAADE community,

The devastation resulting thus far from the fires in <LOCATION> and the Greater <LOCATION> region is nearly unimaginable. More than 10,000 homes or <IN_PAN> have been consumed by the fires, hundreds of thousands have been evacuated, under <IN_PAN> warning, and millions that are without power. While we wish we could say that this hasn’t impacted each of you individually, we know that is not reality.  For those of us who live in the <LOCATION> area, or even have family, friends, or close <IN_PAN> in the area, the <IN_PAN> that you have been impacted directly or <IN_PAN> is great.  We are at a loss for the right words. The thought of this impact is something that we must not ignore; we must accept it, ranging from the impact experienced by others to the impacts on us <IN_PAN>.

For a consolidation of resources, please visit <URL>  In addition to needs related to safety, food, and shelter, there is also the psychological impact of disasters.  We are a community of mental health professionals, and our professional values put us both in the position to provide and receive support from each other and our larger communities.  

If you our somebody you know is experiencing any mental health emergency, please call 988.  For mental health needs that are not life-threatening, please reach out to <PHONE_NUMBER> or visit <LOCATION> Counties Disaster Resource page: <URL> There is also a growing number of <IN_PAN> who have expressed a willingness to provide pro-bono therapy to first <IN_PAN>, fire victims, or those with vicarious trauma related to the fires and cannot afford therapy otherwise.  That list can be found at: <URL>  Please do not hesitate to reach out to professionals on this list if you have experienced loss, personal trauma directly related, or this event has stirred up feelings for you or those you know. Please share (and encourage) within your networks as you find <IN_PAN>.

If you are an independently licensed therapist, or an associate therapist currently working under licensed <IN_PAN>, and you wish to support, you can find the sign up form at: <URL>

If you believe that there is something that CAADE can do for you in response to these disasters, please let us know.

Thank you for all that you do in making our communities better and your service to others.

All the best,

Hello-
I am a new member to the website and I was signing up for some trainings. I <IN_PAN> found a Digital Ethics course, but have since found a different ethics training that I want to take.

Is there a way to un-enroll in a training? If so, could you assist me to un-enroll in this one below? Thanks!

Hello <PERSON>,Thank you for reaching out <DATE_TIME>. I <IN_PAN> you wish to save the audio files from courses. Once a course is purchased, you can view and listen to the contents at anytime within <DATE_TIME>. After this, it could be removed because of being outdated or a new version added. I have used the method I'm sharing below using the web browser Google Chrome. For any courses that you have purchased in <DATE_TIME>, you can go to the ""Content"" portion of the course. I've circled this with a blue circle in <IN_PAN> ""Audio files"". If the course has audio files with it you will see the word ""Audio"" within the course contents. I circled an example of this with the gold marker in the <IN_PAN> ""Audio files"". A new tab will open with that audio file. You can then bookmark the page by clicking the star in the top right hand corner of the rowser. I have circled this with a gold marker in <IN_PAN> ""Bookmark1"". Once you click the star, you can then name this bookmark and name the folder. In this picture I named the folder <PERSON>.

 save, it is possible that the system needs to reset.
The answers that are incorrect on the Posttest should be marked in red and the answer will be removed. I will attach an image for you to reference. Once the incorrect questions are marked you can only focus on those and not need to retake the entire test.

After taking the test a 3rd time and not successfully passing with a 75% or greater, you will need to <IN_PAN> the course. 

Please let me know if you have any <IN_PAN> questions.

Have a great day!

Good Morning,



I am taking the <LOCATION> supervisor's course, I am having difficulty with the last module.  I finished all of the required reading etc and I took the test and did not pass, I stepped away from my computer for quite some time and tried to take it again but it
 needed to refresh, when I did, I lost some of my answers and pressed submit and failed by 1 answer.  I am now second guessing myself on everything.  Is there a way you can track my last post test and reset it?  I only failed by one question and I hate to go
 back and re-read everything again as it is time consuming.  



Also, what happens if you do not pass a third time?  Do you fail?  I passed the others with no issues, in fact, passed the second two with a high score and no issues.



Thank you, <PERSON>

Hi <PERSON>,Glad to hear you passed the first three tests without <IN_PAN>.  To answer your question, each module is its own test so should you not pass, though I am confident you will, you would only need to redo that test.Let us know if you have further <URL>bertZur Institute---- on Mon, <DATE_TIME> -0800  ""<PERSON>>  wrote ---- 


Hi <PERSON>,




I am just going to redo the test as parts of it erased.  




I passed the first 3 modules without an issue, just curious, if I don't pass the last I have to take the entire course over?  That seems extreme.  




Thank you, <PERSON>

The board has filed its annual Notice of Index of Precedential Decisions pursuant <IN_PAN> Code section 11425.60, subdivision (c). The decisions can be found at <URL>

Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) a decision that contains a significant legal or policy determination of general application that is likely to recur may be <IN_PAN> as precedential (see <IN_PAN> Code section 11425.60)
Once a decisions is <IN_PAN> as precedential, the BVNPT will rely on it to make decisions about cases that have similar facts as the precedential decision case.

BVNPT <DATE_TIME> <PERSON>, <PERSON> <US_BANK_NUMBER>  •  OAH No <UK_NHS>  •  <DATE_TIME>
Nursing is a highly regulated field and LVNs must be able to follow <IN_PAN> statutes and regulations. <IN_PAN>'s ability to follow the RCFE <IN_PAN>, though not in the course of her work as an LVN, is therefore related to her practice as a nurse. Although <IN_PAN> was not providing nursing care to L.W., she was responsible for the safety and wellbeing of a <IN_PAN> person. Her failure to comply with a legal <IN_PAN> designed to ensure the safety and dignity of such an <IN_PAN> demonstrates an unfitness to practice nursing. On that basis, complainant proved by clear and <IN_PAN> evidence that <IN_PAN> engaged in general unprofessional conduct when she violated the DSS <IN_PAN> governing treatment of RCFE residents

Unfortunately, the <IN_PAN> who managed that information retired from the company, and we do not have records that date back to <DATE_TIME>.

This leaves you with several options.  You can reply that we are an ASWB approved provider (number 1113)
 and let them decide whether that is <IN_PAN>.


You can wait until we hear back, which, based on our experiences with other boards, may never happen.


Or you can attempt to contact them yourself and see what they say.  


 


We've taken this as far as we can.


I think <LOCATION>' policy falls into the category of great idea, a little short on details.

422353000064982040,2025-01-14 19:40:16,2025-01-14 19:40:16,"Hi there,
I'm <PERSON>, reaching out to introduce the International Council for Online Educational Standards (ICOES). We've worked with many organizations in your industry, and I'd love to show you how our accreditation services can enhance your online courses.
About ICOES
At ICOES, we offer independent accreditation for online courses, helping <IN_PAN> like yours stand out by featuring a quality label from an independent body. Our accreditation seal assures learners of your course's quality, boosts its market value, and validates their achievements. Additionally, our <IN_PAN>-based model provides an opportunity to generate extra revenue.
How Our Certification Benefits You and Your Learners
Accreditation enhances the appeal of your courses and offers optional <IN_PAN> certificates for learners, with no <IN_PAN> for those who prefer not to purchase them. For organizations <IN_PAN> in a long-term partnership, we offer center accreditation and the opportunity to be listed on our âWho's Accreditedâ page for added <IN_PAN>.
Certification Pricing and Process
We offer internationally <IN_PAN> digital and hard-copy certificates:

Digital Certificate: €29.99 with a €15 <IN_PAN> for partners
Hard Copy Certificate: €49.99 with a €20 <IN_PAN> for partners

Our straightforward pricing for accreditation includes:

1-2 courses: €375 annually
3 courses: €475 annually
4-5 courses: €795 <DATE_TIME>
More than 5 courses or Center Accreditation:  €995 <DATE_TIME>

The accreditation process includes a thorough review of your course content, aligned with our quality charter. Following the review, you'll receive a feedback report and a Certificate of Accreditation. The accreditation is valid for <DATE_TIME>, with an easy renewal process.
Finally, if you'd like to learn more or get started, I'd be happy to arrange a call or answer any questions via email. Alternatively, if you prefer a self-service option, our application form is available on our website at <URL>. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need <IN_PAN> information. I'm here to help!
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to <IN_PAN> how ICOES can support your goals.

Hello <PERSON>,Thank you for reaching out <DATE_TIME>. I found a course named: Ethics of Media Interactions for Mental Health Professionals 1 CEThis is a standard course (like many courses here on Zur Institute) and not a webinar. Once you purchase the course you will have <DATE_TIME> to complete.  This course in <IN_PAN> has 3 different formats; articles, audio, and video within the course contents. I have added an <IN_PAN> circled in blue of the area that shows the format. Some courses are articles only while others contain different formats. Webinars will state that they are live with a date to join.

Does the completed certificate for this program come stating <DATE_TIME>, or are individual certificates provided for each of the 5 courses in this program?

I work for the State of CA.  In order to get reimbursed by the state, they are particularly about how the certificate must match the money spent on the certificate.   




I could not find some of the parts of this program listed and priced separately.

Please advise.

I work for the State of CA.  In order to get reimbursed by the state, they are particularly about how the certificate must match the money spent on the certificate.   




I could not find some of the parts of this program listed and priced separately.

Please advise.

My apologies <PERSON>. After checking I do see the upcoming webinar. I used the code NOTES10 and was able to reduce the price 10 dollars on my account. I would recommend using the Google Chrome browser to make this purchase with the coupon(if you aren't already). If you try again from the Chrome browser and it will not let you add the code, you could go ahead and purchase the webinar at full price. Reply back here when you've made your purchase and we will manually refund the 10 dollars for you.

<PERSON>,It's stuck on <IN_PAN> a certificate, because a certificate was never generated on the back end.  We are looking into this, but realistically, it will likely be <DATE_TIME> before this is corrected given <DATE_TIME> is a holiday and the person who can correct this won't return before <DATE_TIME>.We will notify you once it is fixed.Zur Institute---- on Sat, <DATE_TIME> -0800  ""David Ball""<<EMAIL_ADDRESS>>  wrote ---- Unfortunately, I'm still having an issue.

Hi <PERSON>,

Thanks for the clarification! I <IN_PAN> the <IN_PAN> between CEUs and CEs now. I'll check with the NY board to ensure they accept the CEUs for my license renewal.

As for the 62 forms and <NRP> forms, is there any way to adjust the price or exchange for the CEU package? I'd prefer to have the CEUs included if possible.

Thanks again for your help!

Best,

Hello,


    
  

I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, located in <LOCATION>.  I have been enjoying your courses for <DATE_TIME>.


I am now also licensed in <LOCATION>, and would like to take your course on child abuse reporting that is required in <LOCATION>.


    
  

My question is regarding filling out the information on your website.  To date, all of the courses I have taken from you have been for CA license.  I do not see a way to list both licenses, and the ensuing requirements.  Do you have any suggestions about how it would be best to proceed in filling out the information form with accuracy and in a way that will be useful and track my courses?Thanks so much.


    
  

Best wishes,

Hi Julie,All our courses are approved for <LOCATION>, which has its own set of credentialing.  At this time, the child abuse reporting course needs to be specifically approved and as we are in the process of <IN_PAN> for approval, we have removed the <LOCATION> specific course for <URL>garding courses for both states.  You can add your <LOCATION> license number to your account profile so that both license numbers appear on your certificate of <IN_PAN>.  I am including a short video that explains how to do this.  You can fast forward to the one minute mark and see how to add a second license <URL> terms of keeping track of the requirements, we don't have a system, though you can go to our <LOCATION> tool <URL> and look at the requirements.  Unfortunately, both <LOCATION> and <LOCATION> require that the ethics courses include information specific to the <IN_PAN> state, meaning you will need to take two courses, which have mostly the same information.  The only differences is that state specific laws and regulations are different for the two courses.  Any of the other courses will count for both states.Hope this is helpful.Let us know if you have further questions and congregations on expanding your breadth of <URL>bertZur Institute---- on Wed, <DATE_TIME> 13:29:19 -0800  ""Julie friend""<<EMAIL_ADDRESS>>  wrote ----

Hello <PERSON>,Thank you for your reply. The good news is you do not need a vimeo account to view the video and do not need to log in. Clicking on the link below will automatically load the video for you in a seperate tab. After you click the link you can click the ""Play button"" I have circled in the <IN_PAN>. It will show you in detail as a visual aid on how to find the posttest. You can also go into part 3 from ""My courses"" and scroll down to the bottom of the course and a ""Proceed to postest"" button can be clicked. Click here for the brief Video (no need to log in)If you continue to <IN_PAN> an issue, we can with your <IN_PAN> log into your account and see what you see.

Aloha,Thank you for the easy access video.I am still NOT ABLE to access the EMDR Part 3 post-test.  I think this is because I may have already taken the post-test, not realizing that I needed to wait until after <DATE_TIME> session to do so.  I am NOT ABLE to answer question 1 (which asks if I attended all of the required practice sessions - I did!) The computer does not accept my YES answer.  (I also tried a NO answer which also was not acknowledged).Thank you for you <URL><PERSON>

Hello <PERSON>,Thank you for reaching out <DATE_TIME>. I see the course contents you mention is Audio and text. Since you have now completed the course, you would use the ""Activity Progress"" inside the course on the top right of the page (<IN_PAN>: Activity progress). Click on ""Content"" to go back and review the course details. For audio links it will take you to a black page with only the audio controls (<IN_PAN>: Audio1). Click the 3 dots (circled in blue on the <IN_PAN>) and click ""Download"". You can then save it to your computer. Clicking on readable content in the course will open another tab in your browser. Depending on which PDF software you use, there will be a ""Download"" option somewhere on the page. (Attchment: PDF1) In this <IN_PAN>, my computer is using Adobe. I have circled the area of the download location in blue. Alternatively, you could also print this content directly to your printer (circled in yellow). Please let us know if you have any questions.

That's alright, we'll make sure you do.

vulnerable to unauthorized access. Please notify Dr. <PERSON> if you decide to

Good <DATE_TIME> Dr. <PERSON>,This training is not <IN_PAN> with EMDRIA. There are many 
organizations that provide certification in EMDR and to our knowledge, 
EMDRIA certification is not required for any <IN_PAN> opportunities or
 board requirements.  What is essential is demonstration of research 
based, and ethical practice, which this certificate program provides.  Let us know if you have further questions.MichelleSupport TeamSign up <DATE_TIME> for our New <DATE_TIME> <IN_PAN>!Zur <URL>============ Forwarded message ============From:  <<EMAIL_ADDRESS>>To: ""'Zur Institute'""<<EMAIL_ADDRESS>>Date: Tue, <DATE_TIME> 20:59:55 -0700Subject: RE: 20% EMDR training with <DATE_TIME> <IN_PAN> and more!============ Forwarded message ============Are your EMDR trainers EMDRIA certified? <PERSON>, PhDEMDR therapist, first training <DATE_TIME> From: Zur Institute <<EMAIL_ADDRESS>> Sent: <DATE_TIME>, <DATE_TIME> PMTo: <PERSON> <<EMAIL_ADDRESS>>Subject: 20% EMDR training with Annual <IN_PAN> and more!       As an <DATE_TIME> Member you get <DATE_TIME> benefits!

Hi <PERSON>,It all makes sense.  In addition to the posttest, there are two evaluations required by the accrediting organizations.  One pertains to the learning <IN_PAN> and the other is rating of a number of variables <IN_PAN> with the course.  Those are generic questions provided to us and make up <DATE_TIME> and 3.Hence no need to print those out.Let us know if we can provide further <URL>bertZur Institute---- on Wed, <DATE_TIME> 10:14:02 -0800  ""<PERSON> Roche""<<EMAIL_ADDRESS>>  wrote ---- Hello.

<PERSON>,

Thank you for attending Ethics 2025: Key Insights and Ethical <IN_PAN> for Clinical Practice. The course is now available in your account. In order to obtain your CE certificate, complete the following steps:

Login to your <URL> account
Go to My Courses (not My Webinars). You will see the course as Not Started. This does not indicate you did not attend. This simply means you have not started the post-webinar <IN_PAN>.
Click the Start link and scroll down to the bottom of the page where you will see the Proceed to the Posttest link. If you want to review the recording, it will be available on this page <DATE_TIME> following the webinar.
Click the Proceed to the Posttest link and complete the test.  
After passing the Posttest, click the Proceed link to complete both the <IN_PAN> and Activity evaluations.
Once these steps are completed, you will be taken to a page where you can choose the certificate that matches your license. After choosing your certificate, click the Generate My Certificate link. You can either print the certificate or it will be automatically saved in your account for future use.

If you are obtaining Live CEs, per the rules of the accrediting organizations, you must complete this process with <DATE_TIME> of the webinar.  After that date, all certificates will be <IN_PAN> as Home Study/Distance Learning.

Below is the info about the missing webinar: Feb 1, <DATE_TIME>. Perhaps it was canceled and I did not receive notifications. It still shows up in my account. It's too late, 5 min late and no credit, even if it is happening. Which, as someone who has to have live CE, is a bummer. I tried logging in all the ways: from the email, from laptop and from phone; from my account, <URL><PERSON>

Once you have made your choices and added them to your cart, go to your cart to checkout.

                      Hi Klaviyo Customer,
                      
                      We are following up on our previous email to remind you that on
                      <DATE_TIME>, <DATE_TIME> we will be removing our integration with Constant Contact. It looks like you have this integration set up on the following account(s):

                            <URL> - TQGQGK
                          






                      Please note that
                      starting on this date, you will no longer see the Constant Contact integration in your <LOCATION> account. No new data will sync going forward, but all data <IN_PAN> synced via this integration will remain in your <LOCATION> account.
                      
Why are we removing this integration?

                      We are removing the integration to focus on improving other areas of our platform knowing that there are several alternative solutions that exist <DATE_TIME>. We remain committed to offering exceptional integrations with the platforms and tools you use most, helping you collect and store the right data to communicate with customers — in personalized ways at scale — and we’ll be focusing on doing just that.
                      
How do I sync data from Constant Contact to <LOCATION> going forward?

                      After <DATE_TIME>, <DATE_TIME> you can still manually export your data and then manually upload the CSVs into <LOCATION>. You can consult our
                      migration guide for specific guidance.
                      
                      We know that this change could have some impact on your use of <LOCATION> and we’re here to help. Please head to
                      <URL> for further <IN_PAN>.

as recently as <DATE_TIME>. I saw the message that since now 
was the first time logging in to the new system, I had to do a one time 
password reset, which is what I tried to do. After getting this email 
from you, I tried to log in with the password you sent, but the page 
kept going back to the original request page. Also my more than once, 
<DATE_TIME>, also trying to reset password and verify account, 
didn't produce results either, the link never has appeared in my inbox 
nor my spam folder.

I'm <IN_PAN> to your email for two reasons;I'm <IN_PAN> fond of 
<PERSON>, and...I have found that getting my credits on Zur Institute is 
better than anywhere else.
I don't want a <IN_PAN> because I only need 4 more credits to renew my 
psychologists license (for the last time and then I'll retire, but want 
to be sure you maintain a record of all the many course I've completed 
all these years).. I do wish I could get those 4 credits from you now!

From my research, I do not see that you ordered tokens for yourself.  Is this your recollection, or is there possibly an error?Additionally, our system does not allow us to use tokens for <DATE_TIME>.  One other discovery I came across for the account under this email address, is that it has not been accessed since <DATE_TIME>.  Thus, in order to register for and view a webinar, you would need to update your account and provide current license information.If you are wanting to participate for your personal interest and are not looking to obtain CEs, let me know and we can provide you complimentary viewing access.Zur Institute---- on <DATE_TIME> 12:31:<PHONE_NUMBER>  ""Dr. <PERSON>>  wrote ---- Can you sign me up?

<PERSON>,

Thank you for attending Introduction to Deconstructing Anxiety. The course is now available in your account. In order to obtain your CE certificate, complete the following steps:

Login to your <URL> account
Go to My Courses (not My Webinars). You will see the course as Not Started. This does not indicate you did not attend. This simply means you have not started the post-webinar <IN_PAN>.
Click the Start link and scroll down to the bottom of the page where you will see the Proceed to the Posttest link. If you want to review the recording, it will be available on this page <DATE_TIME> following the webinar.
Click the Proceed to the Posttest link and complete the test.  
After passing the Posttest, click the Proceed link to complete both the <IN_PAN> and Activity evaluations.
Once these steps are completed, you will be taken to a page where you can choose the certificate that matches your license. After choosing your certificate, click the Generate My Certificate link. You can either print the certificate or it will be automatically saved in your account for future use.

If you are obtaining Live CEs, per the rules of the accrediting organizations, you must complete this process with <DATE_TIME> of the webinar.  After that date, all certificates will be <IN_PAN> as Home Study/Distance Learning.

Just following up to see if you had a chance to review my last email and if you'd like more details about a potential partnership with ICOES.
We help increase the <IN_PAN> and credibility of educational content while offering a <IN_PAN>-based opportunity for partners to provide international certification, something that has been a <IN_PAN> revenue stream for others in your industry.
Let me know if you'd like more information or if this isn't the right fit at the moment. Also, if there's someone else I should speak with, I'd <IN_PAN> the referral.
Looking forward to your thoughts!

Hi there,
I'm <PERSON>, reaching out to introduce the International Council for Online Educational Standards (ICOES). We've worked with many organizations in your industry, and I'd love to show you how our accreditation services can enhance your online courses.
About ICOES
At ICOES, we offer independent accreditation for online courses, helping <IN_PAN> like yours stand out by featuring a quality label from an independent body. Our accreditation seal assures learners of your course's quality, boosts its market value, and validates their achievements. Additionally, our <IN_PAN>-based model provides an opportunity to generate extra revenue.
How Our Certification Benefits You and Your Learners
Accreditation enhances the appeal of your courses and offers optional <IN_PAN> certificates for learners, with no <IN_PAN> for those who prefer not to purchase them. For organizations <IN_PAN> in a long-term partnership, we offer center accreditation and the opportunity to be listed on our ""Who's <IN_PAN>"" page for added <IN_PAN>.
Certification Pricing and Process
We offer internationally <IN_PAN> digital and hard-copy certificates:

Digital Certificate: €29.99 with a €15 <IN_PAN> for partners
Hard Copy Certificate: €49.99 with a €20 <IN_PAN> for partners

Our straightforward pricing for accreditation includes:

1-2 courses: €375 annually
3 courses: €475 annually
4-5 courses: €795 <DATE_TIME>
More than 5 courses or Center Accreditation:  €995 <DATE_TIME>

The accreditation process includes a thorough review of your course content, aligned with our quality charter. Following the review, you'll receive a feedback report and a Certificate of Accreditation. The accreditation is valid for <DATE_TIME>, with an easy renewal process.
Finally, if you'd like to learn more or get started, I'd be happy to arrange a call or answer any questions via email. Alternatively, if you prefer a self-service option, our application form is available on our website at <URL>. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need <IN_PAN> information. I'm here to help!
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to <IN_PAN> how ICOES can support your goals.
Warm regards,
<PERSON> Copyright <DATE_TIME> ICOES . All rights reserved"

                      Hi there,
                      
                      At <LOCATION>, our goal is to help you grow faster by <IN_PAN> your customer data and <IN_PAN> personalized experiences to your customers across channels.
                      
                      We’re also committed to making buying and using Klaviyo as simple and flexible as possible. The new plan options we shared with you in <DATE_TIME>, created in response to feedback from customers like you, go live <DATE_TIME>! We encourage you to review your new flexible pricing options, and set your Billing Preferences to optimize <LOCATION> for your needs.
                      
Auto-Upgrade AND Auto<IN_PAN> on Profiles
                      At the start of each billing cycle, Klaviyo will automatically upgrade your profile and email plan to match your active profile count. Starting <DATE_TIME>, you can also choose to automatically downgrade to a lower plan when your profile count goes down. So whether you’re growing, or cleaning, your profiles, you can be sure you’re only paying for the profiles and email plan you need. To turn on automatic downgrade, select the option on your
                      Billing Preferences page. You can also find more information on our <DATE_TIME> profile suppression rules
                      here.
                      
Flexible Sending for Email and SMS
                      We know many <IN_PAN> send more emails at specific times of <DATE_TIME>, like over <DATE_TIME>, and want to downgrade to a more normal plan after these peaks. We’re introducing a new option called Flexible Sending that will automatically upgrade you to the plan you need during busy periods and automatically downgrade you at your next billing cycle. No more setting reminders. We’re also introducing flexible sending for SMS plans of at least $495/month.
                      
                      You can learn more about these new pricing options in
                      this video.
                      
                      We’re committed to making our plan options simpler and ensuring you have the tools you need to manage your account, and more importantly, grow your business. If you have any <IN_PAN> questions feel free to reach out to your Customer Success Manager or our
                      Support team.

In one survey, 63% of psychotherapists reported they did not write treatment plans on all clients. Many stated they just didn’t have the time, or didn’t see them as helpful. Yet treatment plans are required by insurance plans, ethics codes, and many state laws. Without an appropriate written treatment plan, you (or your client) may not be <IN_PAN> by a health plan — or may be asked to pay money back. You could also be cited by a licensing or ethics board. Plus, a treatment plan can protect both you and your clients, ensuring all parties have a clear understanding of the goals and progress being made. This webinar will address how to write a brief treatment plan that fulfills the expectations of insurance, ethics boards, licensing boards, and other oversight <URL><PERSON> Events:WEBINARS  Intro to IFS: Learning how to Integrate Parts Work through Internal Family Systems with <PERSON>, MSW, ACADC Sexuality: Common Myths That Undermine Treatment with <PERSON>, PhD Cultural and Clinical Considerations in <NRP> with <PERSON>, LMHC, LCPC, HHP TRAININGSIntegrating EMDR with Internal Family Systems with <PERSON>, MSW, ACADCPROFESSIONAL ENHANCEMENTS Ozempic, Weight, & Identity — A Guide for Mental Health Providers – with <PERSON>, PhD - Non CE event, FREE for Members Bridging the Gap: Building Collaborative Relationships with <IN_PAN> Professionals for Mental Health Providers with <PERSON>, Psy.D, FREE for Members    No longer want to receive these emails?

You can either print the certificate or it will be automatically saved in your account for future use.

<PERSON>,

Thank you for attending Introduction to Deconstructing Anxiety. The course is now available in your account. In order to obtain your CE certificate, complete the following steps:

Login to your <URL> account
Go to My Courses (not My Webinars). You will see the course as Not Started. This does not indicate you did not attend. This simply means you have not started the post-webinar <IN_PAN>.
Click the Start link and scroll down to the bottom of the page where you will see the Proceed to the Posttest link. If you want to review the recording, it will be available on this page <DATE_TIME> following the webinar.
Click the Proceed to the Posttest link and complete the test.  
After passing the Posttest, click the Proceed link to complete both the <IN_PAN> and Activity evaluations.
Once these steps are completed, you will be taken to a page where you can choose the certificate that matches your license. After choosing your certificate, click the Generate My Certificate link. You can either print the certificate or it will be automatically saved in your account for future use.

If you are obtaining Live CEs, per the rules of the accrediting organizations, you must complete this process with <DATE_TIME> of the webinar.  After that date, all certificates will be <IN_PAN> as Home Study/Distance Learning.

If you have any difficulties, the following video walks you through all the steps: <URL>

I’m just curious why this refund was issued. I did not attend the love seminar but was hoping to view the recording if possible. Was this not an option? Thanks for your help.

Hi <PERSON>,Thanks so much for the fast and helpful reply! I have used your calendar link to schedule a meeting for this <DATE_TIME>. I am certainly open to live virtual trainings, as I have done many of these. To be honest, my interest in online asynchronous training is not only that they can be a <IN_PAN> way for <IN_PAN> to <IN_PAN> their CE, but they can be a source of passive income. So perhaps there could be a way for Zur to support both.Of the clips I could find of myself online, this one has the best video quality and does the best job of showing both me and my slides; I queued it up to the 108 second mark when the talk begins: <URL> again!

Thank you <PERSON>. I was so sorry to hear about Dr. <PERSON>'s passing, so sudden. 
 
I did receive the refund, but not the email you refer to, for some reason. No problem.
 
If there is any chance someone else could teach this info, I am very <IN_PAN> in what they have to say that's current. And also, if there is anything else that addresses this in a nutshell in your offerings, please let me know.

Good morning Lloyd, 

If you attend the 1st session of the Training, you will be able to complete the Posttest and 2 Evaluations after the webinar has ended. Once those have been completed, you will be able to generate and download your Certificate of <IN_PAN>.

If you are unable to attend the 2nd session, a recording of the webinar will be available, within <DATE_TIME>, for you to view at your convenience.
However, your certificate of <IN_PAN> will read as an <NRP> and not LIVE.

Please let me know if you have <IN_PAN> questions.

Thank you & have a great day!

I'm just popping in to see if you had a chance to read my previous email and if you'd like me to explain anything else about a potential partnership with ICOES?
We'd love to work with you to help to increase the <IN_PAN> and credibility of your educational content. Furthermore, we provide a <IN_PAN>-based opportunity for partners to <IN_PAN> international certification to their learners. This <IN_PAN> has proved to be a very <IN_PAN> revenue stream with other organizations in your industry and might be of interest to you as well.
However, I'd like to spare your inbox from my keen emails if you decide this isn't the right opportunity now. Let me know if you require <IN_PAN> information or if you would prefer to postpone this matter.
Looking forward to hearing from you,
All the best,
<PERSON>

Hi there,
Just following up to see if you had a chance to review my last email and if you'd like more details about a potential partnership with ICOES.
We help increase the <IN_PAN> and credibility of educational content while offering a <IN_PAN>-based opportunity for partners to provide international certification, something that has been a <IN_PAN> revenue stream for others in your industry.
Let me know if you'd like more information or if this isn't the right fit at the moment. Also, if there's someone else I should speak with, I'd <IN_PAN> the referral.
Looking forward to your thoughts!
Best,
<PERSON>
_______________________________________________
Hi there,
I'm <PERSON>, reaching out to introduce the International Council for Online Educational Standards (ICOES). We've worked with many organizations in your industry, and I'd love to show you how our accreditation services can enhance your online courses.
About ICOES
At ICOES, we offer independent accreditation for online courses, helping <IN_PAN> like yours stand out by featuring a quality label from an independent body. Our accreditation seal assures learners of your course's quality, boosts its market value, and validates their achievements. Additionally, our <IN_PAN>-based model provides an opportunity to generate extra revenue.
How Our Certification Benefits You and Your Learners
Accreditation enhances the appeal of your courses and offers optional <IN_PAN> certificates for learners, with no <IN_PAN> for those who prefer not to purchase them. For organizations <IN_PAN> in a long-term partnership, we offer center accreditation and the opportunity to be listed on our ""Who's <IN_PAN>"" page for added <IN_PAN>.
Certification Pricing and Process
We offer internationally <IN_PAN> digital and hard-copy certificates:

Digital Certificate: €29.99 with a €15 <IN_PAN> for partners
Hard Copy Certificate: €49.99 with a €20 <IN_PAN> for partners

Our straightforward pricing for accreditation includes:

1-2 courses: €375 annually
3 courses: €475 annually
4-5 courses: €795 <DATE_TIME>
More than 5 courses or Center Accreditation:  €995 <DATE_TIME>

The accreditation process includes a thorough review of your course content, aligned with our quality charter. Following the review, you'll receive a feedback report and a Certificate of Accreditation. The accreditation is valid for <DATE_TIME>, with an easy renewal process.
Finally, if you'd like to learn more or get started, I'd be happy to arrange a call or answer any questions via email. Alternatively, if you prefer a self-service option, our application form is available on our website at <URL>. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need <IN_PAN> information. I'm here to help!
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to <IN_PAN> how ICOES can support your goals.
Warm regards,
<PERSON> Copyright <DATE_TIME> ICOES . All rights reserved"

Hi <PERSON>,<IN_PAN> the webinar does not automatically refund your money.  We manually do that after the webinar ends.

Hi <PERSON>,Let's see if we cannot get this straightened out for you.  What  <PERSON> sent you is a list of courses you have purchased with your <IN_PAN>.  You do have both <PERSON>, Foolish Choices, and Helping People Make Better Decisions in your account. They are the same, though one is the name of the webinar and the other the name of the course for which you would receive CE credits.  I know it is complicated. The two names was an oddity  as we changed the name after <IN_PAN> posting the webinar online, resulting in two names for the same event.  However, you were not charged for both, only one when you <IN_PAN> for the Sept 28, 2024.  I am curious as to how you would have paid for this through your <IN_PAN> as the course is not available for purchase on our site. In case you did attempt to add it to your account, our system will not allow one to purchase the same course multiple times, so even though you may have attempted to purchase one or the other of these courses, you would not have been charged. It is possible there is a glitch in our system and the best way to determine this is for you to see how many credits you have remaining in your <IN_PAN>.   You can find this information by scrolling down to the bottom of the My Account link><DATE_TIME> <IN_PAN> and then clicking that link.  I have attached screenshots to guide this process.  Our records indicate you have purchased 17 CEs with your <IN_PAN>.  Thus, you should have 7 credit remaining.Here is the link to the certificate program.  One needs to scroll down the page past the autism certificate to find it.  It is on our list to simplify this.Let us know what else we an assist you <URL>bertZur Institute---- on Mon, 10 Mar <DATE_TIME> -0700  ""KURT WAGNER""<<EMAIL_ADDRESS>>  wrote ---- Good Morning Michelle!Thanks for your fast reply!  This is the course I’m talking about.

Dr. CowanYou raise some notable considerations, and causes me to wonder whether you chose the correct option for a certificate.  There are psychologists in about 7 states that need live interactive CEs, which <LOCATION> used to require.  If you do not need live interactive CEs, there should have been an option for you to choose a different certificate that read Psychologists in <LOCATION>, <LOCATION> and <LOCATION>.  I will look into this further to be sure that option was available to you.  .All of this boils down to APAs <IN_PAN> accreditation process for webinars which they have <IN_PAN> refused to alter, in spite of numerous conversations and offers to help.  They continue to implement rules regarding webinars that were developed over <DATE_TIME>, when they were among the few organizations offering online webinars.  Having The <IN_PAN> Center for Psychotherapy (SCP) sponsor this event, is APAs recommendation as a way to adhere to its own regulations.  The term ""responsible for this program and its content"" is required by APA as is the number of posttest questions, and the exact wording of the questions regarding <IN_PAN> of the program.  The ""responsible for this program and its content""  means that the content has been reviewed by SCP to assure the content meets APA's standards, not that they put the webinar on.  If you are not in need of ""live interactive"" CEs, we can send you our certificate, though <LOCATION> and every other state with the exception of <LOCATION> (which does not recognize APA approved courses, but allows ours)  will accept either certificate.Let us know how you would like to proceed. <PERSON>, PhDDirector Zur InstituteZur Institute---- on <DATE_TIME> Mar 2025 17:35:37 -0800  ""R C""<<EMAIL_ADDRESS>>  wrote ---- To Whom It May Concern, I took the training <DATE_TIME>, Intro to IFS: Learning how to Integrate Parts Work through Internal Family Systems by <PERSON>, MSW, <URL>ter receiving my certificate I realized the center that awarded and person that signed the certificate does not appear to be <IN_PAN> with <URL><PERSON>. Then, I saw the notification regarding CEs (copied below) on your website.   ""CE credits for psychologists outside of <LOCATION> state will be provided by <IN_PAN> Center for Psychotherapy.  <IN_PAN> Center for <LOCATION> is approved by the American Psychological Association (APA) to sponsor <IN_PAN> education for psychologists. <IN_PAN> Center for <LOCATION> maintains responsibility for this program and its content.""This brings up areas of concern:1) The CE certificate appears to imply that <PERSON>, Ph.D. provided the training.2) Unfortunately, when viewing the website for the <IN_PAN> Center for Psychotherapy, I did not locate any <IN_PAN> of the American Psychological Association (APA) to sponsor <IN_PAN> education for psychologists.3) I did verify this organization at APA Approved Sponsors of <IN_PAN> Professional Education.  And, unfortunately, there is a <IN_PAN> that the information might not be up to date.4) At this point, I am not comfortable using these CEs for my license.  This is <IN_PAN> given I paid for CEs that would unequivocally be able to be used.I did enjoy the training and have taken ZUR training before without encountering this issue.   And, at this point, now I am concerned about taking any further training with <URL>ncerely,Dr. <PERSON>, Ph.D., Licensed Psychologist, PSY30019Oak Psychological Services3161 <PERSON>, Suite <IN_PAN> Park, CA 95682*This e-mail and any attached files transmitted with it may contain confidential information and may be read or used only by the intended recipient.

		CalSavers was created by state law and designed to make it easy for employers to run a simple <IN_PAN> program for their employees. As a business owner with 1-4 employees* in <LOCATION>, you’re now required to register if you do not offer a qualified <IN_PAN> plan for your employees.

  Help your employees join the 500,000 <NRP> already saving with CalSavers.
  Your deadline to register and start facilitating CalSavers is <DATE_TIME>, <DATE_TIME>.

Get started. All you need is your:

   Federal Employee Identification Number (FEIN) or Tax Identification Number (TIN)
   <LOCATION> payroll tax ID number from the <IN_PAN> Development <IN_PAN> (EDD)
   CalSavers access code: <PERSON>

  Please have the Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or Tax Identification Number (TIN) for your business ready when you contact Client Services.

  *Employer eligibility and mandate status is based on an employer’s average number of employees
from <DATE_TIME>. This number is <IN_PAN> by averaging the number of employees reported
to EDD on an employer’s four DE9/DE9C filings from <DATE_TIME>.
  






























This communication is not a <URL>is email was sent to you on behalf of the State of <IN_PAN> – CalSavers Program in <IN_PAN> with Title 21 (<IN_PAN> with Section <US_DRIVER_LICENSE>) of the <IN_PAN> Code.

The CalSavers <IN_PAN> Savings Program (“CalSavers” or the “Program”) is an automatic <IN_PAN> payroll deduction IRA overseen by the CalSavers <IN_PAN> Savings Board. Participants saving through CalSavers beneficially own and have control over their IRAs, as provided in the Program <IN_PAN> Booklet available at <URL>.

CalSavers is a <IN_PAN> voluntary <IN_PAN> program. Savers may opt out at any time or reduce or increase the amount of payroll contributions. If a saver opts out they can later opt back into CalSavers.

CalSavers is not sponsored by the employer, and therefore the employer is not responsible for the Program or liable for the decisions employees make with respect to the Program. Employers are not permitted to endorse the Program or encourage or advise employees on whether to participate, how much (if any) to <IN_PAN> or provide <IN_PAN> help. Employers do not provide financial advice and employees should not contact an employer for financial advice. Employers should refer all questions about the Program to CalSavers. Employers are not liable for decisions employees make, pursuant to Section <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> of the <IN_PAN> Code.

This email was sent on behalf of the <IN_PAN> State Treasurer’s Office - CalSavers by Ascensus College Savings Recordkeeping Services, LLC. Ascensus is the <IN_PAN> program administrator for CalSavers and is responsible for <IN_PAN> program <IN_PAN>.

Hi <PERSON>,Here are links to the  articles you are missing.  There are two links to the forensics and corrections article and I am not sure which was part of the course.  As they are both short, I am including <URL> an FYI, the reason we no longer include these articles in the updated course is that some of it is dated.  However, since you have the course and are almost done, we are providing this to <URL> us know if you need anything else.Zur Institute---- on <DATE_TIME>, 13 Mar <DATE_TIME> -0700  ""Jon Eng""<<EMAIL_ADDRESS>>  wrote ---- Hi <PERSON>,    Thanks for these resources.
