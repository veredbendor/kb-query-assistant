her issuer for further information, as banking privacy regulations 
prevent the issuer from sharing the decline reason with third parties. The recommended handling path for this error is to inform the buyer 
that the transaction has been declined, he or she should contact his or 
her credit card issuer for details on the reason the transaction was 
declined, and that he or she should use an alternative funding source 
for the transaction. Note: Some cards may be blocked from online transactions, or even 
cross border (international) transactions. We recommend credit card

Check with your licensing board regulations, your state’s laws, and your professional ethics about employing TeleMental Health in your practice. So NBCC is correct in answering you in saying that Zur Institute courses would not allow you ""to practice telehealth counseling"".

Instead, 
the Council has adopted rules that outline what is considered 
appropriate continuing education. This means a licensee can receive 
continuing education from any person or organization that provides the 
education in accordance with the Council’s rules. No approval by the 
Council is needed for the individual or organization to engage in the 
delivery of continuing education. Licensees are still audited for 
continuing education compliance and during those reviews, staff evaluate
 the continuing education documentation submitted. If you were an

For example, there is an Agent called ""ZI Support"" in the Help Desk system, and the email for that agent is: support@zurinstitute.com . So, emails forwarded TO the support@zurinstitute.com email can be properly associated with the ""ZI Support"" agent. 2) In order to properly associate a customer with a forwarded email, the forwarded email must contain the keyword ""#original_sender"" followed by the customer's email address in curly brackets at the top of the email body , like this: #original_sender {sender_email} Example: #original_sender { customer@emailaddress.com } Once the Help Desk accepts a forwarded support email, a ticket is created which will be properly assigned to the forwarding agent, and to the customer with the ""#original_sender"" address.

Help Desk: Incoming Missed Phone Calls - Delay setting to Spam,"The new toll-free support phone number on the 'Contact Us' page is 833-961-1344: This phone number is connected to the Help Desk, and can be used for all incoming and outgoing calls, as well as incoming and outgoing texts. All incoming and outgoing calls and texts can create and update Help Desk tickets, just like email. Agents can set their status to receive Help Desk calls and/or email by clicking on the top right Agent icon. If an incoming call is missed, and the caller does not leave a message, a ticket is created. At this point, it is an open question as to whether that was a spam call, or whether it was a legit call where the caller decided to use another channel, like email, or the Knowledge Base, instead. Do not set unknown tickets to Spam, unless and until you are pretty sure it is spam. This is because once a ticket is set as Spam, the incoming phone number or email address that generated that ticket will no longer be accepted by Help Desk. If in fact that initial call was not spam, but we set it to spam and the customer decides to call back later, the system will not accept their calls later. It is recommended that tickets created from questionable incoming calls be set to 'On Hold' for a week or so. After a bit of time, when it's clear that there won't be any more meaningful calls coming in from that number, it can be set to Spam.",Help Desk,False,2019-08-19 05:15:32,2020-06-10 06:03:08

The Agent can create and send email from within that ticket however. For example, here is how a Help Desk Agent would create a new support ticket to send Student Certificates out: Create a new ticket, connect it to the Contact (i.e. Customer), set the Subject line as you do "" Zur Institute Certificate Program Cert Attached: [course goes here] "". Leave the Description field blank and click [Submit]. This creates an empty ticket. Open it and click ""reply"" and complete the body and attachments as normal.
